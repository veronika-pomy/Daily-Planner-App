## Functionality

- The app includes standard working hours from 9 am to 5 pm
- The app utilizes the Day.js library to update date and time features dynamically
- The calendar displays the current day (weekday and date) at the top of the page
- The time blocks are organized into 1-hour segments 
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future 
  - Gray is for the past, red is for the present, green is for the future
- When users click on time blocks, they can enter tasks and save them 
- The app utilizes local storage to save tasks 
- When the page is refreshed, the saved tasks continue to appear on the calendar
